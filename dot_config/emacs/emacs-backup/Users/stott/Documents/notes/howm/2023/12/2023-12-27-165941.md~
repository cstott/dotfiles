Hown Principles

1. Take notes on anything you find useful, important, interesting.
   
2. Limit the length of each note to one idea; this makes it easier to construct them later on in any manner.

3. Link notes when their respective ideas engage in a dialogue.

4. Use a reliable program that you can trust for your writing.
