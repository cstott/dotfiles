* Notes
** Discovered [[denote:20231207T081705][Org-mode speed keys]]
To see commands go to start of the org heading and press '?'
** Saw interesting project on org-dungeon to teach emacs
Project to teach people emacs and org through a game like experience. Looks pretty cool: https://github.com/chainsawriot/orgdungeon
